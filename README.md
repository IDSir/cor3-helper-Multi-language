# COR3 Helper

A Chrome extension that enhances the [cor3.gg](https://cor3.gg) experience by monitoring markets, expeditions, daily ops, and providing timer alerts — all from a compact popup UI.

## Features

- **Theme Support** — Multiple color themes to match your preference
- **Pop-up Window / Panel Support** — Exports the UI to pop-up window or side panel depending on your preference
- **Refresh System** — Either by using "refresh all" button or by clicking "refresh" for each section, it refreshes related data available on the UI
- **Pinned Timers** — Every timer except "RESTING" timer for mercenaries can be pinned to top of the UI for tracking.
- **Auto Job Refresh** — If the "auto-refresh" checkbox next to pinned job timer is enabled, jobs get automatically refreshed when they reach zero. This gives users more jobs per day by triggering them earlier and giving enough time to finish
- **Auto Decrypt Hacking** — Automatically solves decryption hacks when enabled. Just toggle it on and the extension handles the rest
- **Auto Daily Hacking** — Automatically solves log integration hack and gives results of signal hack when enabled. Check information below it for signal hack results.
- **Daily Ops** — Countdown to your next daily ops task with streak bonus, difficulty, and claim status
- **Market Monitoring** — View Market-1 (HOME) and Market-2 (D4RK) stats, job reset timers, items list, and jobs list (with Category/Server/Reward columns)
- **Active Expedition Tracking** — See active expeditions with remaining timer, cost, risk, insurance, and mercenary info
- **Expedition Decisions** — View and respond to pending decisions by clicking them with score calculation
- **Auto Choose Decision** — Auto choose decisions 1-min before deadline according to their scoring. Configure loot/risk modifiers to change how scoring works.
- **Inventory Viewer** — Browse your stash sorted by rarity (rarest first) then price, with item/storage details, total value, and last-updated timestamps
- **Mercenaries** — View mercenary callsign, rank, status, specialization, traits, mission count, cost, rest timers, risk, failed-survive chance, and death chance.
- **Auto Send Mercenary** — Enable "auto send" toggle and select a mercenary to send just after current expedition is done. It auto-claims previous reward container.
- **Auto Choose Mercenary** — Enable "auto choose" toggle for extension to do best mercenary selection according to their cost and risk values.
- **Archived Expeditions** — View past expeditions with outcome, cost, risk, location, loot container details and item images. Auto-loaded on startup
- **Multi-Alarm System** — Create multiple configurable alarms for any timer (daily ops, market job resets, expeditions). Each alarm has its own threshold, volume, continuous mode, and on/off toggle
- **Version Tracking** — Displays extension, web, and system versions
- **Check for Updates** — Compare your installed extension, web, and system versions against the latest on GitHub. It lets user know if an update is required for extension or if web/system versions are different from what's stored.
- **Cache-First Design** — Data loads instantly from cache on popup open. Use the "Refresh All" button or per-section refresh buttons to fetch fresh data
- **Real-Time Updates** — WebSocket listeners auto-update daily ops, markets, expeditions, decisions, inventory, mercenaries, and archived expeditions when data arrives
- **Lightweight** — Only intercepts existing WebSocket traffic and re-triggers some API calls that the game already sends
